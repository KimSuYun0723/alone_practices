  #[Hypothesis]
#H0: There is no difference in frequency between the two groups, complex and simplex words. 
#HA: There is a significant difference in requency between the two groups, complex and simplex words. 

  #t-test
t.test(simf,comf)

  #[report]
#There was a significant difference in frequency between complex and simplex words. 
#The independent t-test result indicates that the frequency of simplex word was higher (t(12.62) = 3.1652, p < 0.01).

  #[interpretation]
#As p-value is lower than 0.01, H0 should be rejected and HA is adopted instead. 
#In other words, the complex word appear less frequently than simplex word.



#Problem 2. Do words appear in the singular form more frequently than in the plural form?

#[Hypothesis]
#H0: There is no difference in frequency between the two types of words, singular and plural form.
#HA: The frequency of words of singular form is not the same as the plural form.

  #t-test
t.test(freq_sing, freq_plu, paired = TRUE)

  #[report]
#There was no significant difference in in frequency between two types of words, singular and plural form (t(80)=1.5221, p = 0.1319), 

  #[interpretation]
#As p-value is greater than 0.05, H0 should be kept.
#That is, the difference in frequency between singular and plural form is not significant.

  #[interpretation]
#As p-value is greater than 0.05, H0 should be kept. 
#That is, the difference in word length between fiction and non-fiction is not significant.
