sophie_2 = """Sophie went back to the park and searched the area, looking for any clues. Suddenly, she saw something glimmering in the bushes. She ran towards it and found a small, hidden treasure chest. Sophie carefully opened the chest and inside, she found more coins and a note. The note read:
'Congratulations! You have found my treasure. Please keep one coin for yourself and share the rest with your friends and family. Remember to always follow your curiosity and keep exploring.'
Sophie was overjoyed. She took one coin and shared the rest with her loved ones. From that day on, she always carried the coin with her as a reminder to follow her curiosity and explore the world around her.
Her adventure taught her an important lesson about being curious, asking questions, and investigating. Therefore, it really made her feel a lot.
