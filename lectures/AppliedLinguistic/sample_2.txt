I wake up feeling sick. This is partly because I drank so 
much wine with my friends last night, but mostly because 
today's my thirtieth birthday.
Thirty years old. I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
How can I be thirty?
OK, OK. I know thirty isn't exactly old, but it's a lot 
older than twenty-nine, believe me. You see I had a long 
list of things I wanted to do before I was thirty. Actually, 
now Iâ€™ve got two lists, my original list and a new one, 
because three weeks ago my life changed forever. But I'll 
tell you about that in a moment. Here are the lists:

List One
1. Travel around the world.
2. Write a bestselling book.
3. Buy a house or a flat, preferably with a garden and 
a sea view.
4. Give up smoking.
5. Give up headaches due to drinking too much.
6. Give up problem boyfriends.
7. Go skiing this Christmas instead of visiting my 
Family.

List Two
1. Have a conversation with Brad Courtney lasting 
longer than five minutes and without my knees 
shaking.
