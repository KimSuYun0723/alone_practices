The Wahiba Sands - a soft sand desert in north east 
Oman. Two hundred kilometres from north to south; a 
hundred from east to west. Long dunes run north to south, 
long lines of sand, always changing, always moving in the 
wind.
On its west side, Wahiba is a long wall of red sand, fifty 
or sixty metres high. It runs slowly down on to the empty 
desert, which is the centre of Oman. Hard, stony and flat as 
a table, this desert is the eastern side of the great rubâ€™al-
khali, the Empty Quarter.
In the easr. the dunes of sand run down onto long, empty 
beaches. Crabs and seabirds live there by day. and green 
turtles often come out of the sea to lay their eggs by 
night. After the beaches, there is only the deep blue-green 
water of the Arabian Sea for fifteen hundred kilometres to 
Gujarat in northern India.
The sands of Wahiba are empty and quiet. There is no 
sound. Nothing bigger than a lizard can live in the great sea 
of soft, red-gold sand; nothing bigger than matram grass can 
grow there. You hear nothing but the blood in your ears, 
and the hot dry air going in and out of your mouth.
To walk in the soft sand is difficult. It pulls your feet as 
you walk. Your legs soon hurt and you get tired very 
quickly. To move at all is hard work.
